<!--
ECMA6 test of the Toybox example.
You no longer need ; at the end to evaluate lines you can have it if you want.
I found an interesting set of variable comparisons that would be useful for mathematical functions like fib, trib and reversing arrays without the function.
also the same syntax can be used with objects. 
classes are defined by the class keyword. you no longer need the var Class = function() syntax. 
the constructor method in the class instantiates the class.
functions of prototype no longer need Class.prototype. you can state them like you would in other languages.
you can use (a,b) => for evaluating functions. 
the let key word lets you handle block scope. if var is used, it will still replace block scope with function scope.
let can be used in a block (e.g a for loop) so that outside the block it will be different. 
strings can be concatenated using `` terminology. declaring variables in `` is found by using ${}.
Functions that handle objects and arrays can be handled intuitively. I thought this might be useful for how the toybox receives the data from toys. 
you could make a function that has conditions based on the type of toy, for example.
