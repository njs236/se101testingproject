# se101testingproject
More arduous tasks to complete to test your knowledge of Javascript!

In the documentation you will find any requirements that were drafted for this project. The documentation has examples of mocha and 
jasmine, and reports of students (cutting out the course evaluations) and a variety of risk and quality management documents.


Included in the repository are:

1. dinosaur javascript test - a test adding dinosaurs to a database based on Families and Species

2. ECMA6TestFeatures - Writing a toybox example. the allocation of the time as well as the document that i did research with are 
					included in "Breakdown of Time"
					
3. Evaluations of Courses - Reports for course leaders. N.B the reports with names are still in the documentation, but the 
						    responses are anonymous
						 
4. model answer - includes model answers for the dinosaur test, the monarchs test, and the test builds using Mocha and Jasmine. 

5. monarch practical test - A test adding monarchs (with their marriage dates) and Fiefdoms regarding a fictional world.

6. testing - these are for the students. they have no code except function parameters. Also includes mocha and jasmine test 
		     frameworks for determining success or failure (some tests are meant to fail)
